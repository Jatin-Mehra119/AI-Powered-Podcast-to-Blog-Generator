A powerful tool that automatically converts podcast audio into comprehensive blog content and other marketing assets using AI.

## Overview

The AI-Powered Podcast to Blog Generator is designed to streamline the content creation process for podcasters and content marketers. It takes audio files from podcasts and automatically generates:

- Well-structured blog posts
- SEO elements (title, meta description, tags, keywords)
- FAQ sections based on episode content
- Social media posts for Twitter/X, LinkedIn, and Instagram
- Newsletter summaries
- Memorable quotes from the episode

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (generated by Claude 3.7 Sonnet)
- **AI**: Groq API for LLM (Large Language Model) capabilities
- **Transcription**: Whisper Large v3 Turbo
- **Search Enhancement**: Optional Tavily API integration for web research

## Project Evolution

This project evolved through several development stages:
1. Initial prototyping in Jupyter Notebooks
2. Conversion to Python scripts with command-line interface
3. Implementation of FastAPI for the backend
4. Addition of frontend interface (generated entirely by Claude 3.7 Sonnet)

## Features

- **Audio Transcription**: Converts podcast audio to text using Whisper Large v3 Turbo
- **Smart Content Generation**: Creates high-quality blog posts from transcripts
- **Web Research**: Optional capability to enhance content with relevant web-searched information
- **Multi-format Output**: Generates various content formats from a single audio file
- **User-friendly UI**: Simple drag-and-drop interface for audio uploads
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Background job processing for large audio files
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time job status updates
- **Multiple Language Support**: Can process audio in English, French, Spanish, Hindi, German, and Italian

## Workflow

1. User uploads a podcast audio file (supported formats: MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG)
2. User selects desired content output types (blog post, SEO, FAQ, etc.)
3. System transcribes the audio using Whisper Large v3 Turbo
4. LLM processes the transcript to generate the requested content types
5. User can download the generated content files

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Groq API key
- Tavily API key (optional, for enhanced web research)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jatin-Mehra119/AI-Powered-Podcast-to-Blog-Generator.git
cd AI-Powered-Podcast-to-Blog-Generator
```

2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your API keys:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key_here
```

## Usage

### Web Interface

1. Start the FastAPI server:
```bash
uvicorn api:app --reload
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
3. Upload your podcast audio file and select desired content options
4. Wait for processing to complete
5. Download the generated content files

### Command Line Interface

You can also use the CLI version:

```bash
python main.py --audio path/to/your/audio.mp3 --model meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct --content blog seo faq social newsletter quotes
```

## Architecture

The application is structured as follows:

- `api.py`: FastAPI server implementation
- `main.py`: Command-line interface
- `modules/`: Core functionality modules
- `preprocessing.py`: Audio transcription and cleaning
- `generate_blog.py`: Blog post generation logic
- `content_generation.py`: Other content type generators
- `frontend/`: Web interface files (HTML, CSS, JS)
- `output/`: Generated content files
- `temp/`: Temporary storage for uploaded files
- `logs/`: Application logs

## Limitations

- Maximum audio file size: 20MB
- Processing time depends on audio length and selected content types
- Requires internet connection for API access
